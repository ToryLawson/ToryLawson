### ðŸ‘‹ You seem nice! Hope everything's going great for you today.

A couple of admissions:

1. I love F# like I love harp seals---they're amazing and deserve protection and I would love to play with them all day but I have to make a living.
2. I had a strange and intense loyalty to Ruby and only recently came to terms with the fact that, deep down, I prefer Python, like everyone else.

I'm currently in grad school for computer science, learning machine learning. I love time-series stuff and reinforcement learning. I was prepared to feel disappointed once I learned how all these things worked but I've only come to be more amazed as I've gone along.

I know this is a super tough sell, but if you love F# and regex then I'd welcome your help with my regex modeler. Another tough sell: if you love testing and reinforcement learning, I have another project (currently set to private) that would be a lot of fun to work on, I promise.

Finally: I want to help you with your stuff, send me an email!
